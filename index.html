					<h1 class="mb-5">Welcome to the WW1 Irish Soldiers Database</h1>
					<p>
						Our database contains a wealth of information on Irish soldiers who
						were treated in British-run hospitals after World War 1. This data
						includes their name, age, rank, unit, home address, next of kin as
						well as recording their reason for admittance, the
						type of wound they sustained, and any comments made by the doctors
						treating them.
					</p>
					<p>
						This data was collected from multiple national archives where it was
						stored on paper, much of which was illegible. The data was then
						painstakingly transcribed into Excel spreadsheets one record at a
						time. We are proud to have assembled this valuable resource, which
						will be a valuable aid to researchers, historians, and students
						studying Irish history during the war.
					</p>
					<p>
						For an academic the hospital records allow an in-depth study be made
						of a dataset that is firmly based in a particular region i.e. the
						newly independent twenty six counties of Ireland, using a large
						study group over a substantial period of time. Disability studies
						has become a noteworthy topic across several academic disciplines in
						recent years, especially as in the twenty-first century, we strive
						for an inclusive society. How people who suffered from physical and
						psychological issues were treated in the past can help us improve
						how we deal with these issues in the present and in the future.
						Recent conflicts have shown that the effects of war do not end when
						peace finally comes. Physical and mental trauma often carries on for
						many years. For those who study the 'War to end all wars' the
						potential to study the long-tern effects of that war on such a large
						group of people is unprecedented.
					</p>
					<p>
						We hope that this database will help to shed light on the
						experiences of these soldiers and honor their contributions to the
						war effort. Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you find
						it a useful tool for your research and studies.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						If you have any questions or comments about the database, or if you
						have additional information that you would like to contribute,
						please feel free to contact us using the form on the Contact page.

						<h2 class="section-heading">A "Lost Generation"</h2>
						<p>
							It is beyond contestation that certain groups suffered
							disproportionately higher casualties than others, but this is
							always true in war. British and Empire fatalities are estimated to
							have been almost 900,000 out of approximately eight million people
							who served in the military. At a personal level many dealt with
							the grief of losing a loved one by cherishing their memory
							throughout long periods of mourning or in a more tangible way such
							as personal keepsakes. The emotions felt by those who chose this
							path were quite often private and very personal. But many within
							society and among the relatives of the unprecedented numbers of
							missing needed something more. They found a focus for their grief
							and loss in the more formal commemorative process that developed
							in the years following the war and that commemorative process
							seemed to dominate the public perception of the war.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the decade of commemoration there has been an increased
							interest in the many Irish men and women who served in the First
							World War. There is an increasing amount of literature on the
							Irish involvement in the military aspects of this conflict. There
							is a limited amount of literature available about the individuals
							who called the newly independent Irish Free State, home. Many
							accounts detail the number of dead suffered on all sides and are
							often illustrate this with a photograph of rows of headstones, or
							in the case of a documentary, a panning shot across one of the
							many graveyards scattered across the landscape of northern Europe.
							Whatever the final number of dead may have been there was an even
							greater number of soldiers who were injured or acquired a
							debilitating illness.
						</p>
						<p>
							The total number of sick and wounded has been re-assessed over
							time. It is estimated that 2.3 million British soldiers were
							treated for wounds, of which 7% later died and 8% were invalided
							out of the service. Many others returned to full or limited
							military service depending on the severity of the wounds suffered,
							sometimes to be wounded a second or more times. These groups,
							their dependants and those who later received war pensions in
							respect of injuries or illness seem to have received less
							publicity than smaller more newsworthy groups. If the war dead
							were the "Lost Generation" of the early twentieth century, this
							origin of this work was the idea that the wounded and sick of the
							war, especially those who were disfigured or disabled could well
							be considered a "Forgotten Generation".
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">The Data</h2>
						<p>
							A good deal of the available literature of those who served in the
							Great War examines the psychological damage experienced by
							veterans, a phenomenon then known as Shellshock or Neurasthenia,
							and now more commonly referred to as Post Traumatic Stress
							Disorder (PTSD). The research from which this dataset is taken is
							different in that it deals more specifically with those who
							suffered from what mainly physical disabilities, although this
							does not mean that many veterans suffered from combinations of
							both physical and mental trauma. This is a feature that will
							become apparent as the data is analysed.
						</p>
						<p>
							The research from which this dataset is taken is different in that
							it deals more specifically with those who suffered from what can
							be described as mainly physical disabilities. In the compilation
							of official figures for disability pensions awarded by the
							Ministry of Pensions, psychological conditions of all types were
							categorised as diseases which meant that they were accounted for
							in the non-combatant category. An analysis of the annual reports
							published by the British Ministry of Pensions from 1918 to 1939
							show that even at its greatest level, an average of just 9% of the
							disability pensions awarded were for a psychological disorder
							directly attributable to the war service of an individual. The
							logical conclusion from these figures is that the overwhelming
							number of pensions awarded were for physical injuries or diseases.
							This facet of the story of disabled veterans of the Great War has
							not been considered in as great an amount of detail as has the
							story of the victims of Shellshock.
						</p>
						<p>
							Even for example, if the statistics from the first Ministry Report
							are adjusted to categorise psychological injuries as wounds, the
							number of disease related disability pensions still exceed those
							awarded for wounds or injuries in the proportion of 51% to 49%.

						<h2 class="section-heading">The Nature of the Medical Care</h2>
						<p>
							The British government, through its Ministry of Pensions, put in
							place a three level system of care for disabled veterans in the
							Irish Free State. The first level of care was provided by medical
							general practitioners (GPs) who provided treatment as needed to
							any veteran who was in receipt of a disability pension. The GPs
							were paid for their services by the London based Ministry of
							Pensions. In the early years of the Irish Free State there were
							approximately 27,000 men availing of this service. British
							Treasury estimates were that the cost for this was near £2.600 per
							annum.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second arm of the triumvirate of medical services available to
							disabled veterans of the Great War in Ireland were outpatient
							clinics. A clinic offered specialised treatment for more serious
							or persistent wounds or illnesses. They could be located in either
							civilian or Ministry of Pensions run hospitals. They came to be
							regarded as a more efficient and cost-effective way of providing
							care for veterans. During the war civilian hospitals had provided
							invaluable aftercare for many sick and wounded personnel leaving
							Ministry of Pensions and military medical staff free for more
							immediate primary care of patients.
						</p>
						<p>
							After hostilities ended there were concerns that disabled
							servicemen were not receiving the best possible care in civilian
							run clinics albeit through no fault of the hospital concerned. For
							instance, in Dublin city at that time, there were eighteen
							civilian hospital providing various outpatient facilities for
							disabled veterans and as an example of the numbers involved, in
							November 1920 alone these treated 2,199 ex-servicemen over 14,727
							separate visits.

							the numbers of non-Ministry medical institutions in use during
							November 1920.</span
						>
						<p>
							Eventually these clinics were reduced to just two Ministry of
							Pensions run establishments based in Dublin and Cork, a factor
							that resulted in a significant saving in the cost of continuing
							medical care for veterans in the Free State. This is illustrated
							in the table below extracted from Ministry of Pensions files.

						<h2 class="section-heading">The Hospital Patient Registers</h2>
						<p>
							In 2017, Eoin Kinsella published a history of the Leopardstown
							Park Hospital as part of the centenary celebrations of that
							establishment Which is located adjacent to the Leopardstown
							Racecourse. It is currently a HSE facility that specialises in the
							care of geriatric patients. In addition, it also provides for the
							care of elderly pensioners who had been members of the British
							Armed Forces. This is a legacy from when the hospital was one of
							two British government hospitals in south county Dublin that had
							been established to care for the sick and wounded of the First
							World War.
						</p>
						<p>
							The other hospital was the Blackrock Special Orthopaedic Hospital
							that was situated on Carysfort Avenue, a relatively short distance
							from Leopardstown. During his research Kinsella discovered seven
							patient registers of First World War veterans from the two
							hospitals ranging from the 1920s to the mid-1940s. Except for
							Admission and Discharge Books five to seven, they are not
							chronologically contiguous and as such they can be classified into
							four distinct groups.
						</p>
						<h5 class="section-heading">
							Book 1: Blackrock Admittance and Discharge Book April 1920 -
							August 1926.
						</h5>
						<p>
							This book contains the earliest set of records for ex-officer
							patients in the Blackrock hospital for this period that has been
							found. The 286 entries in this volume also contain details of six
							females who served in various branches of the nursing services who
							were acquired a debilitating injury or disease as a result of
							their service. As was the case then, as it is still now, the
							medical treatment of officers and nurses was strictly segregated
							from that of enlisted personnel.
						</p>
						<h5 class="section-heading">
							Book 4: Colonial Chelsea Pensioners Admission and Discharge Book
							May 1920 to June 1945.
						</h5>
						<p>
							Peculiarly, this book does not record actual Chelsea Pensioners,
							so well known for their archaic red uniforms and tricorn hats.
							Rather this book is a record of Irishmen who were disabled in the
							armed forces of Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United
							States. Having chosen to return to Ireland to live, their medical
							care was undertaken in Ministry of Pension facilities under
							reciprocal arrangements with those countries for the treatment of
							British and Irish disabled veterans who chose to live in those
							parts of the Empire.
						</p>
						<h5 class="section-heading">Books 5-7:</h5>
						<h5>
							Leopardstown Park Admission and Discharge Book Aug 1930 to Oct
							1936.
						</h5>
						<h5>
							Leopardstown Park Admission and Discharge Book Oct 1936 to May
							1942.
						</h5>
						<h5>
							Leopardstown Park Admission and Discharge Book May 1942 to July
							1945.
						</h5>
						<p>
							These three books form the largest record of its type known to
							exist in the British Isles. All told, they contain a total of
							3,050 entries, some of which chronicle individuals who were
							admitted on several occasions including an ex-Private of the Royal
							Army Service Corps (RASC) who was a patient no less than nineteen
							times between July 1928 and October 1942.
