						Welcome to the WW1 Irish Soldiers Database
					</h1>
					<p>
						Our database contains a wealth of information on Irish soldiers who
						were treated in British-run hospitals during World War 1. This data
						includes their name, age, rank, unit,home address, next of kin as
						well as records of the reason for their admittance to hospital, the
						type of wound they sustained, and any comments made by the doctors
						treating them.
					</p>
					<p>
						This data was collected from multiple national archives where it was
						stored on paper, much of which was illegible. The data was then
						painstakingly transcribed into Excel spreadsheets one record at a
						time. We are proud to have assembled this valuable resource, which
						will be a valuable aid to researchers, historians, and students
						studying Irish history during the war.
					</p>
					<p>
						We hope that this database will help to shed light on the
						experiences of these soldiers and honor their contributions to the
						war effort. Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope you find
						it a useful tool for your research and studies.
					</p>

						If you have any questions or comments about the database, or if you
						have additional information that you would like to contribute,
						please feel free to contact us using the form on the Contact page.
