						<h2 class="section-heading">The Dataset</h2>
						<p>
							The 4,741 entries in the original dataset were made in ink by
							different administrative personnel in unknown conditions. The
							original documents contain mistakes in spelling, variations in the
							use of abbreviations and arithmetic errors. Many entries display
							this evidence of human error in the not infrequent non-standard
							entries, in addition to additions, deletions and some instances of
							almost illegible cursive script. The greatest care has been taken
							to eliminate as many of these issues as possible and to
							rationalise the information that is contained in the ledgers.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">File Reference Number</h2>
						<p>
							The majority of the entries have a Ministry of Pensions (MoP)
							reference number, for example: 13/MW/2074. '13' identifies that
							this file relates to a person living in the Irish Free State, what
							is now the Republic of Ireland. '12' signifies the six counties of
							Ulster that remained in the United Kingdom. The first letter
							signifies the arm of service of a veteran. 'M' is for army
							service. 'N' for Royal Navy service. 'AF' was for service in the
							Royal Air Force. The second letter is the first letter of the
							surname of a veteran, in this case the 'W' is for the family name
							Weldon. The last number is the number of individuals with that
							surname initial who were in receipt of a disability pension. There
							is no known list or roll of Great War disability pensioners
							extant. Surviving records in the Nation Archives UK have not
							retained this information for a number of reasons.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								The Annual Reports of the MoP did not differentiate between the
								different parts of the British Isles and only published overall
								figures.
							</li>
							<li>
								The deliberate and accidental destruction of many documents in
								the 1930s.
							</li>
							<li>
								The destruction of documents by German bombing during the Second
								World War.
							</li>
							<li>
								The decision by NAUK to retain only 2% of First World War
								pension files as samples of the material produced.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Besides identifying an individual, the MoP reference enables an
							estimate to be made of the number of disabled veterans living in
							Ireland during this timeframe by identifying the highest number
							recorded for each initial and adding them together. Academics have
							not found another way that this might be done.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Unit Column</h2>
						<p>
							This entry is usually abbreviated. It provides a cross section of
							the various regiments and corps that Irish men and women served
							in.
						</p>
						<a link href="#abbreviationsInfo"
							>Click here for a list of abbreviations</a
						>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Service Number</h2>
						<p>
							All service personnel were given a number on enlistment. During
							the First World War there was no centralised system for this. Each
							regiment or corps issued numbers according to their own system
							that was independent of any other. Therefore, it is possible to
							find more than one person with the same name and number, but they
							were completely different people in different military units.
							Another complication is that if an individual was transferred from
							one regiment to another, they were often given a new number which
							confuses an already confusing situation.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Rank</h2>
						<p>
							Rank is of limited use as promotions, demotions, temporary ranks
							and appointments were not uncommon events.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Age</h2>
						<p>
							The age on admittance can be used to work out the age of a person
							during the period 1914 to 1918. It can also be used to determine
							if there was any correlation between that age and the reason for
							admittance, for example if there was a likely of a disease
							recurring as the years progressed.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Reason for Admittance</h2>
						<p>Three categories are used for this entry.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								GSW. The common abbreviation for Gun Shot Wound. This has been
								used for all who suffered traumatic injury by bullets or
								explosions that could be attributed to direct enemy action.
							</li>
							<li>
								Disease. Used to classify those suffering from some disease,
								sickness or injury as a result of, or aggravated by their
								military service. Using the criteria applied by the Ministry of
								Pensions at that time, this includes all personnel who were the
								victims of gas or chemical warfare, as well as psychological
								disorders.
							</li>
							<li>
								Both. Veterans who were unfortunate to have disabilities or
								ailments that fell into both categories 1 and 2.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Diagnosis</h2>
						<p>
							The majority of admissions were for only one medical reason.
							However, over 500 veterans were admitted suffering from two or
							even three issues for which they received treatment. One category
							that is very apparent is the number of pensioners who suffered
							from some sort of respiratory or pulmonary disorder. The large
							numbers these conditions found and the ability to categorise them
							have led to a reappraisal of the health of surviving disabled
							veterans. Besides various medical terms used in the Diagnosis
							columns, the most used abbreviations are R: Right, L: Left, Ampt:
							Amputated/Amputation.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">
							Admission/Discharge date and Duration of Stay
						</h2>
						<p>
							In addition to measuring the length and frequency of each stay in
							hospital, the rate of admission and discharge can be determined,
							as can whether there were any seasonal or other similar trends.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Religion</h2>
						<p>
							Unsurprisingly Roman Catholic (RC) is recorded as the religion for
							the majority of entries in the dataset. The others are Church of
							Ireland (CoI), Church of England (CoE) and Presyterian (Pres).
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Next of Kin</h2>
						<p>
							Where it is recorded, the relationship of the Next of Kin to the
							disabled veteran is noted as well as their home address if
							different to that of the veteran.
						</p>
						<h2 class="section-heading">Home Address</h2>
						<p>
							The addresses found are broken down by county, town or district
							and street if possible. This method facilitates a demographic
							survey of disabled veterans to be undertaken.

				<h1 class="text-center mb-5">Regiment/Corps Abbreviations</h1>
				<p>
					These abbreviations were commonly used to identify different
					regiments, which were groups of soldiers organized under a particular
					commander. The table lists various regiments and their corresponding
					abbreviations found within the database, which would have been
					important for communication and record-keeping during the war. This
					information would have been critical for commanders, staff officers,
					and other military personnel in ensuring effective communication and
					coordination on the battlefield. This info was directly transcribed
					from the paper records, so there may be some errors.
